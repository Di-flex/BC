1.2 (Apr 10 2021)
- First Beta Release


1.3 (May 2021)
Loot and Rewards
- Added locked chests which are scattered around the dungeon. Each floor is guaranteed to have at least one locked chest but is likely to have more be locked. You can either pick them or unlock them
- Added key drops and lockpick drops around the dungeon. You can find them in debris piles, but not chests.
- Added handcuffs trap, which places a set of handcuffs on you that has a guaranteed lock on it
- Added harness trap, which locks you in a harness that makes it easy for enemies to grab onto you
- Added a kinky belt trap to keep you aroused
- Added various other restraints from chests
- Added scaling to the kinds of locks you encounter:
- New locks:
	Red locks are the most common in early levels, and can be only opened with red keys.
	Green locks are less common, and have a chance of jamming, making them impossible to unlock.
	Yellow locks require both a red and a green key to unlock.
	Blue locks require blue keys, and can't be picked or cut off.
Shrines
- Added Shrines! These allow you to offer gold and will basically take restraints off in exchange.
- Shrines for the goddesses of the elements, conjuration, and illusion who grant spells
Balance
- Made the rope snare have a 3 turn delay rather than a 1 turn delay, and a range of 1. This limits its in-combat use, while retaining its long duration and level 1 classification
- Willpower no longer regenerates, instead you must find a willpower shrine to regenerate your willpower. The cost increases exponentially.
- Conjure Slime now doesn't last forever, but stuns enemies for longer
- Various other tweaks and fixes
Mechanics
- Enemies now have resistances and weaknesses. Discover them the hard way!
- Miscast chance: While aroused, you have a chance of spells being either cast on your position or blowing up in your face and hitting you!
- When you click on an open door, you have an option to close it
- Some enemies (like the new witches) can open doors! Beware!
- Vibrators have a charge which is increased by casting spells.
New Enemies:
- Added a new enemy, a rope snake that sacrifices itself to wrap you up!
- Shock witches that cast electrical spells at you from a distance
- Chain witch who fights by throwing chains at you. She will attempt to close the gap, and will lock the chains in place if she gets near!
- Slime witch that hurls slime balls and conjures pools of slime at you! She is a formidable opponent, be careful not to get trapped against her as she can create tremendous amounts of slime!
Spells
- Electrify spell which is a delayed blast that also briefly stuns
- Chain bolt spell which stuns enemies
- Slime ball spell which conjures a ball of slime that leaves a sticky trail. Use with caution!
- Shield and Barrier, two Conjuration spells for blocking projectiles
- Shroud, a defensive spell which makes melee more difficult inside an area
- Mistcall and Leap, teleportation spells with different strengths and weaknesses. Mistcall uses verrbal components so it can be used to escape from a sticky situation.
Other
- New brickwork visuals
- The map has more doors, but some of them will be open at the start of the game. You can close them to prevent zombies from chasing you.
- Added Undressing System. Certain things will pull clothes off, you gain arousal when this happens and visually will blush when extremely naked and aroused.
- You can now hear the last chat message while ingame!
- The game is persistent so if you hear chat you can exit out and communicate

2.0 (January 2022)
Gameplay Overhaul
- Removed willpower. Stamina is the primary resource now for determining whether the player gets captured
- New consequences when an enemy closes the gap and you have 0 stamina
- Stamina is overhauled. It does not regen except when sleeping. You can click a button to sleep for 20 turns to regain 20 stamina. If you are attacked then you wake up automatically, but you are blinded while sleeping so you won't be able to see enemies coming. You can cancel sleep by hitting any key.
- Mana is now a separate resource. It does not regenerate, but mana potions can restore it.
- Each shrine now has a mana pool. You can drink mana from any of the mana pools once per floor without repercussions. This restores your mana fully. Drinking more than once on the same floor (from any number of shrines), however, has a chance to backfire.

TODO Character customizer, change outfit and/or the player character's appearance, either have it save or make it use a code to load

TODO ValidationFindBlockCycles to prevent bugs

TODO: Mushrooms in the jungle

TODO Goddess minibosses: (+ means its added already)
+Rope kraken, many sub-ropes that drag you to center. Casts a spell that attaches ropes, if you have enough attached it replaces your outfit with a swimsuit, leotard, or some kind of lingerie with maybe magical tape gags.

-Either slime related stuff or maybe just a latex witch who is very powerful

TODO

Nurse (applies straitjackets and stuff)
Doctors (Applies sedatives and euphoric drugs)
Troopers (Riot shield and tasers)

Enemy ideas:
-Silent sentinel, triggers ambush when the player casts a verbal spell, tries to gag the player

Future content planned:
- Wand item which reduces mana costs but is terrible for melee
- Witches should drop their respective spells sometimes if you don't already have them
- Slimes which clean up items, dissolve doors, and potentially corrupt traps and such
- Slimes that catch your sword and trap it
- Enemies that grab your melee weapon and disarm you
- Perk system with perks that allow you to decrease or increase spawns of certain restraints, affect your stats, etc.
	- One Punch: Melee based perk that drastically increases melee damage but drastically reduces your ability to cast magic
- Exit stair puzzles (like for example a button or special key somewhere in the level, maybe with a high likelihood of traps)
- Inescapable yoke that needs keys, but the trap also summons rats that steal the keys and run away
	- Trapdoor (?) that drops you into the above bonus level, with no enemies other than the rats. You wake up feeling stiff, and a yoke is on your arms...
- Rats should have a kleptomaniac AI that steals items and holds them, drops them on death, and runs away from the player when confronted
- jail bars that block movement but not vision and spells
- Tranquilizer/stamina drain from an enemy (bandits? raiders?)
- Boss rooms every few floors
- Magical rope traps which require enchanted knives or advanced spells to cut?
- Enchanted knives, which are found only in chests
- Latex witches that cast latex imprisonment spells at you from a distance
- Mummification from the feet up in an egyptian style level
- Mana-boosting mittens which increase spell power and decrease mana costs, but make it harder to struggle out of things (being mittens)
- Enchanted heels of various sorts (immunity to slow, immunity to slime, bonus to kick attacks, etc)
- Chastity belt trap that puts a plug in you, increasing your arousal while walking
- New shrine: chastity goddess. Places you in a set of magic cuffs that prevent you from being restrained in those slots. However if your stamina falls below half, the cuffs snap together until you get back to full stamina!
- Traps that look slightly different. Usually found on brickwork, so if you avoid brickwork you can avoid them.
- Bombs
- Vines in the undergrorund jungle (when it gets implemented)
- Some sort of end state for high arousal... maybe an orgasm button that lets you succumb to the effects for several turns to bring it down to zero, and maybe "edging" items that prevent this from happening and instead cause increased stamina drain or constant random interruptions
- locked doors that trigger when you step on an obvious looking brickwork that's only generated on tiles you can avoid, maybe with some sort of sleep gas hazard or something to force a time limit if you cant progress
- Monster Encyclopedia
- Heels of avoiding traps: Causes all traps and dangerous terrain (slime, ice) to not affect the player

Spell Ideas:
- Clear Jam spell, which clears jammed green locks from either an object or the player, depending on where it is cast
- Divine Cuffs, a spell which gives you glowing arm and leg cuffs that block low level restraints from being put on you. Lasts for the whole floor.
- Ice Storm, a temporary AoE which has a chance to deal damage and stun creatures inside. Drains player willpower but does not slow or restraint the player.
- Sleep, puts nearby creatures with low willpower to sleep until they take damage. Works on zombies, and also the player if the player is at low stamina.
- Clairvoyance: Cost a lot of mana to be able to see inside of a chest
- Conjure Bomb
- Icicle traps that deal ice damage if enemies step on them
	- Cone of Cold: Creates icicles that do 1-2 cold damage when stepped on
- Temporary Wall spell
